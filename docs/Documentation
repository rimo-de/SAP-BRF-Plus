German Tax Deduction Calculation using BRF+

 1. Objective
    The objective of this requirement is to design and implement a tax calculation engine in BRF+ that automates the derivation of German tax deductions. The system should calculate VAT, Corporate Tax, Solidarity Surcharge, and Trade Tax based on financial input values.

 2. Scope
    Automate multi-step tax calculations using BRF+ formulas and rulesets.
    Provide flexibility to adjust tax rates and formulas without modifying ABAP code.
    Ensure transparency in tax calculation logic by maintaining all rules in BRF+.
    Support simulation and testing of tax scenarios for validation.

 3. Inputs
    The function will accept the following input parameters (Data Object: `ZFI_FUNCTION_INPUT`):
      o	 Total Revenue (`ZFI_TOTAL_REVENUE`)
      o	 Total Expenses (`ZFI_TOTAL_EXPENSE`)

 4. Processing Logic (Business Rules)
    The system will apply the following rules sequentially through the ruleset (`ZFI_DE_DERIVE_TAXES_RULESET`):
      o	Calculate VAT which is 19% of Total Revenue
      o	Derive Taxable Profit which is Total Revenue – VAT – Total Expenses
      o	Calculate Corporate Tax which is 15% of Taxable Profit
      o	Calculate Solidarity Surcharge which is 5.5% of Corporate Tax
      o	Calculate Trade Tax which is 14% of Taxable Profit

 5. Outputs: The function will return results in the output data object:
      o	 VAT Amount (`ZFI_VAT_AMOUNT`)
      o	 Taxable Profit (`ZFI_TAXABLE_PROFIT`)
      o	 Corporate Tax (`ZFI_CORPORATE_TAX`)
      o	 Solidarity Surcharge (`ZFI_SOLIDARITY_SURCHARGE`)
      o	 Trade Tax (`ZFI_TRADE_TAX`)
