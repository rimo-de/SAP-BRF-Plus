# Business Requirement Document (BRD)

## Title: German Tax Deduction Calculation using BRF+

### 1. Objective
The objective of this requirement is to design and implement a **tax calculation engine in BRF+** that automates the derivation of German tax deductions. The system should calculate VAT, Corporate Tax, Solidarity Surcharge, and Trade Tax based on financial input values.

### 2. Scope
* Automate **multi-step tax calculations** using BRF+ formulas and rulesets.
* Provide flexibility to adjust tax rates and formulas without modifying ABAP code.
* Ensure transparency in tax calculation logic by maintaining all rules in BRF+.
* Support simulation and testing of tax scenarios for validation.

### 3. Inputs
The function will accept the following **input parameters** (Data Object: `ZFI_FUNCTION_INPUT`):

* **Total Revenue** (`ZFI_TOTAL_REVENUE`)
* **Total Expenses** (`ZFI_TOTAL_EXPENSE`)

### 4. Processing Logic (Business Rules)

The system will apply the following rules sequentially through the ruleset (`ZFI_DE_DERIVE_TAXES_RULESET`):

1. **Calculate VAT**
   * Formula: 19% of Total Revenue
   * `VAT = Total Revenue * 0.19`

2. **Derive Taxable Profit**
   * Formula: Total Revenue – VAT – Total Expenses
   * `Taxable Profit = Total Revenue – VAT – Expenses`

3. **Calculate Corporate Tax**
   * Formula: 15% of Taxable Profit
   * `Corporate Tax = Taxable Profit * 0.15`

4. **Calculate Solidarity Surcharge**
   * Formula: 5.5% of Corporate Tax
   * `Solidarity Surcharge = Corporate Tax * 0.055`

5. **Calculate Trade Tax**
   * Formula: 14% of Taxable Profit
   * `Trade Tax = Taxable Profit * 0.14`

### 5. Outputs

The function will return results in the **output data object** (`ZFI_FUNCTION_RESULT`):

* **VAT Amount** (`ZFI_VAT_AMOUNT`)
* **Taxable Profit** (`ZFI_TAXABLE_PROFIT`)
* **Corporate Tax** (`ZFI_CORPORATE_TAX`)
* **Solidarity Surcharge** (`ZFI_SOLIDARITY_SURCHARGE`)
* **Trade Tax** (`ZFI_TRADE_TAX`)

---

### 6. Expected Outcome

* The system should calculate all tax components correctly based on the given revenue and expense inputs.
* The ruleset should be reusable, configurable, and testable via BRF+ simulation.
* Results should be transparent and traceable to individual formulas.
* Future tax rate changes should be maintainable directly in BRF+ without ABAP code modifications.
